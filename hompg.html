Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people
to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and 
work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component 
of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective
abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we 
live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to 
personal, community and socio-economic development.

        <h3 class="hed1">Determinants of Mental Health</h3>
        <pre class="p1">
            
  Throughout our lives, multiple individual, social and structural determinants may combine to protect or undermine
   our mental health and shift our position on the mental health continuum.

  Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can make
   people more vulnerable to mental health problems.

  Exposure to unfavourable social, economic, geopolitical and environmental circumstances – including poverty,
   violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – also increases people’s risk of experiencing mental health conditions.

 Risks can manifest themselves at all stages of life, but those that occur during developmentally sensitive periods,
  especially early childhood, are particularly detrimental. For example, harsh parenting and physical punishment is known
   to undermine child health and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions.

 Protective factors similarly occur throughout our lives and serve to strengthen resilience. They include our individual social
 and emotional skills and attributes as well as positive social interactions, quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods
  and community cohesion, among others.
